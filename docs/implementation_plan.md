# CommandCore Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

CommandCore is an advanced AI Agent Orchestration system that leverages Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from domain-specific knowledge bases. The system is designed to provide accurate, contextually relevant responses to user queries across three key domains: AI, Cloud Computing, and Virtualisation/OS.

## System Architecture

The project follows a containerised microservices architecture with the following core components:

1. **Orchestration Service**
   - Built on OpenAI Agents SDK for agent definition and management
   - Implements tool selection logic and task handoff capabilities
   - Manages conversation context and response formatting

2. **PostgresML Nodes**
   - Domain-specific vector databases (AI, Cloud, Virt-OS)
   - Integrated ML capabilities via PostgresML and pgvector
   - Hybrid search functionality combining vector and structured queries

3. **Ingestion Service**
   - FastAPI-based document processing pipeline
   - Parser & Embedder for text extraction and vectorisation
   - DB Writer for storing processed data in appropriate PostgresML nodes

4. **User Interface**
   - Web-based interface for querying the system
   - Displays responses with source citations
   - Simple, intuitive design for easy interaction

5. **Ingestion UI**
   - Web-based document upload interface
   - Metadata entry forms for document categorisation
   - Progress tracking for document processing

   - Implement automated scaling

## Technology Stack

1. **Backend**
   - Python 3.10+
   - FastAPI (Ingestion Service)
   - OpenAI Agents SDK (Orchestrator)
   - PostgresSQL 15+ with PostgresML and pgvector

2. **Frontend**
   - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
   - Simple static web server

3. **Infrastructure**

   - Comprehensive source citations

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional Requirements**
   - Accurate retrieval of relevant information from the knowledge base
   - Proper domain identification and tool selection
   - Comprehensive and contextually relevant responses

2. **Performance Requirements**
   - Query response time under 3 seconds for typical questions
   - Document processing at a rate of at least 1 page per second
   - Support for at least 10 concurrent users

3. **Security Requirements**
   - No critical security vulnerabilities
   - Proper authentication and authorisation
   - Protection against common attack vectors

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the CommandCore system, focusing on the core components and prioritising functional requirements while addressing performance and security concerns.
